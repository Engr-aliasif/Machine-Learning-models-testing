# Machine-Learning-models-testing
This repository provides an interactive Streamlit application for testing and visualizing machine learning models with different Datasets.

#Description
Users can easily upload datasets in CSV or Excel format, apply preprocessing steps like label encoding, and select columns for analysis. The app supports various plotting options (bar, scatter, line) and allows users to experiment with different machine-learning models, such as Decision Tree Regression. The goal is to offer a user-friendly interface for quickly evaluating the performance and relationships within your data, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

#ML Models:
 Linear Regression,
 Decision Tree Regression, 
 Random Forest Regression,
 K-Nearest Neighbors Regression.

#Dataset
